# odin-library

The objective of this project was to learn how to use object constructors, as well as a solid dose of DOM manipulation to get the form input to the page. 

This was a bit of an undertaking for me figuring out how to associate the table elements with the objects in the array. I still think my solution is imperfect here, but it's a good start and most importantly, it works! :)
